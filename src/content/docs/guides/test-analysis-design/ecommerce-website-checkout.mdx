  Example 1: E-Commerce Website Checkout Feature
---


Situation:
✓ An e-commerce company wants to enhance its checkout process to improve user experience
and reduce cart abandonment rates.
ATDD Approach:
➢ User Story: As an online customer, I want to receive a confirmation message once my purchase
is complete so that I know my transaction was successful.
➢ Acceptance Criteria:
▪ A confirmation page is displayed after the purchase is complete.
▪ The confirmation page shows the order number, purchase date, and items purchased.
▪ An email is sent to the customer with the order details.

Questions:

- "Improve user experince" how?
- Nothing about what's bad about the current customer experience
- And more

Development:
✓ The development team, along with business analysts and QA specialists, collaborates to define
the acceptance tests based on the acceptance criteria.
✓ The QA team writes the acceptance tests before the feature is developed.
✓ Developers create the checkout feature to pass these predefined acceptance tests.
Outcome:
✓ The feature is only considered complete
