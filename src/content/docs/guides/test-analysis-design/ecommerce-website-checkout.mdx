  Example 1: E-Commerce Website Checkout Feature
---

The below example is taken from the training slides.

## Situation:

An e-commerce company wants to enhance its checkout process to improve user experience
and reduce cart abandonment rates.

> Notes on why this is a poorly written story:
> - 'Enhance' is not made clear. Performance? UI improvements?
> - No product feedback to indicate probably causes of cart abandonment rates
> - No specifics on what will be improved

ATDD Approach:

User Story: As an online customer, I want to receive a confirmation message once my purchase
is complete so that I know my transaction was successful.

Acceptance Criteria:
- A confirmation page is displayed after the purchase is complete.
- The confirmation page shows the order number, purchase date, and items purchased.
- An email is sent to the customer with the order details.


Development:
- The development team, along with business analysts and QA specialists, collaborates to define
the acceptance tests based on the acceptance criteria.
- The QA team writes the acceptance tests before the feature is developed.
- Developers create the checkout feature to pass these predefined acceptance tests.

**Outcome**:  
The feature is only considered complete once all acceptance tests have passed to ensure it meets the requirements.
