title: Boundary Value Analysis
---

Helps in selecting test cases by focussing on the boundary values of input variables or conditions, as these values tend to be more error prone.

BVA is usually combined with equivalence partitioning.

Characteristics of BVA:
- Proves the points at which the rule changes have been encoded are correct
- For each boundary marker, three boundary values might be tested.

Could be caused by an "off by one error", or a logic or spec bug.

## Two boundary analysis

## Process

1. Identify the input variables or conditions (e.g. age is an integer)
2. Determine the boundaries, e.g. min, max and sections in between
3. Select test cases that focus on the boundaries (just below, exactly on, and just above)
4. Consider additional test cases, e.g. extreme values, crash or hack values.
