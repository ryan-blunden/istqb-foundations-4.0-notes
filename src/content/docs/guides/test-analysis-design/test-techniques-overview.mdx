Test techniques are systematic approaches used to design ana analyze tests to uncover deects or verify the conformance of a system or software product to its requirements.

Various techniques:

## 1. Black Box Testing

- Test system without knowledge of internal structure or implementation details.
- Equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, decision table testing, state transition testing, etc.


## 2. White Box Testing

Also known as structural testing, white box testing invovles testing the internal structure, design.

## 3. Experience-based test techniques

- Also known as heuristic or information techiques, relies on the tester's knowledge, skills, and experience to identify potential defcts.
- Not formal specifications or predefined test cases, but it's based on intution or gut feeling.
- Experience-based techniques rae highly flexible and can complement other formal techniques
- Relies on a tester's domain and systems knowledge which makes their intuition an effecitive tool for identifying potential issues tool that could be missed by formal test cases or specs alone.
