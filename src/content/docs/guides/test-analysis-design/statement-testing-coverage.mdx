title: Statement Testing and Statement Coverage
---

Goal is to ensure every line of code is tested.

By analyzing the coverage achieved, testers can identify untested or uncovered parts fo the code.

But achieving high code coverage does not mean that the software is free of defects and is functionaly complete.

It just ensures that statements have been executed, but not that all scenarios have been tested.

Benefits:
- Early defect detection
- Improved code quality
- Enhanced reliability
- Better maintainability
