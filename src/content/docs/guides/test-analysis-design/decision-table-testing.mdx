title: Decision Table Testing
---

**EXAM**: Do practice examples 3, 4, 5 and 6 to get comfortable with the calculations.

Systematic and structured approach to testing that helps identify combinations of conditions and actions to be tested.

Idea is that we get more effective and efficient test case creation. Less is more.

Implementation example.

To calculate number of tests: 2 to the power of the number of conditions.

So in this example, it's 2 to the power of 3 because there are 3 conditions (Red, Amber, Green).

Q: How many columns do I need?
!: 2 to the power of the number of conditions.

Q: How do I know if I have enough?
A: 2 to the power of the number of conditions.

Ensure each unique combination of conditions is tested.
Cross-check that each condition at least once in each combination
Confirm that all possible actions 
Review the decision table with subject matter experts and stakeholders to validate its completelness
Perform test case executiuon

This gives you the confience you've covered all the required combinations.
