title: Equivalence Partitioning
---

Reduces the number of test cases required while still providing adequate coverage of the system under test.

Divide the input data into different partitions or classes, you can then assume that another input within that same partition will work correctly.

Characterisitics:
- Input/output put into groups expected to exhibit the same behaciour.
- Example: Exam grading. No point testing 30 and 29 as they're both a D.

Principle:
- You only need one test value from each partition to prove the rule

> **EXAM**  
> One test per partition (valid and invalid), question will be, how many tests needed if there are X partitions? May specify valid and invalid.

This example has six partitions (two invalid, four valid) so would require six tests.

An example of a less obvious invalid partion could be a non-integer input.

Following are the steps to apply:

1. Identify the input variables or conditions  
2. Define the input partitions
3. Select tese cases
4. Execute the test cases
5. Repeat for other partitions
