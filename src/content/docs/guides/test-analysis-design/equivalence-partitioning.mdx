Reduces the number of test cases while still providing adequate coverage of the system under test.

Divide the input data into different partitions or classes, you can then assume that a nother input within that same partition will work correctly.

Characterisitics:
- Input/output put into groups expected to exhibit the same behaciour
- Example: Exam grading. No point testing 30 and 29 as they're both a D.

Principle:
- You only need one test value from each partition to prove the rule

**EXAM**: One test per partition (valid and invalid), question will be, how many tests needed if there any x partitions? May specific valid and invalid.

This example has six partitions (two invalid, four valid) so would require six tests.

Less obvious are (TODO lookuop)

Following are teh steps to apply:

1. Identify the input variables or conditions  
Ask the developers, BAs, what is we're checking. A tester couldn't possibly know how to test a login form without input

2. Define the input partitions : TODO (go back)

4. Execute the test cases

5. Repeat for other partitions

Goal: Minimize the number of test cases required.
