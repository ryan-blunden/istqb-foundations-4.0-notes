Design test cases that encompass all branches in the code until desired coverage is attained.

Branch coverage is a metric that quantifies the proportion of tested branches to the toal branches within the code


Branch coverage inherently includes statement coverage, but the opposite isn't true.

**EXAM**: Know how to calculate the number of branch and statement tests to achieve 100% coverage.

Importance of branch testing:
- Understanding the control flow graph, representing the multitude of code paths.
- Measuring coverage: Aspires to attain predefined coverage level by probing every branch in the code.
- Inclusive of statement coverage

Summary:
- White box testing allows testers to design test cases with preciison
- Level of granularity helps identify subtle programming craft
