  Example 2: Hospital Management Software
---


Situation:
✓ A hospital is developing a new patient registration system to streamline the process of
admitting patients and managing their records.
ATDD Approach:
➢ User Story: As hospital staff, I want to easily register new patients and access their records so
that I can reduce waiting times and improve patient care.
➢ Acceptance Criteria:
▪ The system allows staff to enter all necessary patient information through a simple
interface.
▪ Patient records are created instantly and are easily accessible.
▪ Duplicate records trigger an alert to the staff.

Questions and concerns:
- Words like "streamline" and "easily" are ambiguous
- "As hospital staff". Who? exactly?
- Where is the current evidence and feedback that details why it needs to be streamlined? We need a quantitative target to hit in order to know the change has been a positive one.
- System allows "staff". Who?
- "All necessary patient information"—this needs to be defined
- "Patient records... are easily accessible"—who will be accessing it, how will they be accessing it (e.g. iPads?)
- Has someone from security analysed this to see what the risk of information leaks and exposure is? 

Development:
✓ The ATDD process starts with defining clear acceptance criteria in collaboration with healthcare
professionals and administrative staff.
✓ Acceptance tests are written prior to development.
✓ The development is guided by these tests to ensure all features meet the defined criteria.
Outcome:
✓ The system is implemented successfully, having met all the acceptance tests, leading to
improved efficiency and patient satisfaction.
