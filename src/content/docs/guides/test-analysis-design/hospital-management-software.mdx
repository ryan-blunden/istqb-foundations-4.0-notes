  Example 2: Hospital Management Software
---

The below example is taken from the training slides.

**Situation**:  
A hospital is developing a new patient registration system to streamline the process of
admitting patients and managing their records.
ATDD Approach:

> Notes about why this is not a great story:
> - Words like "streamline" and "easily" are ambiguous
> -  "As hospital staff". Who? exactly?
> - Where is the current evidence and feedback that details why it needs to be streamlined? We need a quantitative target to hit in order to know the change has been a positive one.
> - System allows "staff". Who?
> - "All necessary patient information"—-this needs to be defined
> - "Patient records... are easily accessible"—who will be accessing it, how will they be accessing it (e.g. iPads?)
> - Has someone from security analyzed this to see what the risk of information leaks and exposure is? 

**User Story**:  
As hospital staff, I want to easily register new patients and access their records so
that I can reduce waiting times and improve patient care.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- The system allows staff to enter all necessary patient information through a simple
interface.
- Patient records are created instantly and are easily accessible.
- Duplicate records trigger an alert to the staff.

**Development**:  
- The ATDD process starts with defining clear acceptance criteria in collaboration with healthcare
professionals and administrative staff.
- Acceptance tests are written prior to development.
- The development is guided by these tests to ensure all features meet the defined criteria.
Outcome:
- The system is implemented successfully, having met all the acceptance tests, leading to
improved efficiency and patient satisfaction.
