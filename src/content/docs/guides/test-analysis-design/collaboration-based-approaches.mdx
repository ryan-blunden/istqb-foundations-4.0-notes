Collaboration

Collaborative User Story Writing

- Involves testers in the process of creating and refining user stories.

The three C's of user stories:
- Card
- Conversation
- Confirmation

## User story expansion

As a user, I want t- upload files s- I can manage my documents online.

Questions t- ask:
- WHO: What users? Wh- is this for?
- Wh- should and shouln't be able t- see these documents?
- HOW: How and where will they store files?
- WHAT: What files can be uploaded?
- What is the supported volume of files?
- Size of files?
- Management: Once uploaded, how will I manage my documents?
- Meta data for files
- Can the file be amended, or edited
- Can it be shared

Good example of how a seemingly simple feature can quickly expand int- an epic.

Then you start building test cases:
- As an unauthorized user, I can't upload or access files.

One the tests are written, TDD or test automation can execute the tests.

This collaborative approach is great as it leverages the combined experience and creativity of the group—not just relying on one person t- think of everything.

## INVEST

An accepted set of criteraia or checklst t- asses the quality of a user story.

- Indpendent
- Negotiable
- Valuable
- Estimable
- Small
- Testable

## Acceptance criteria

- Conditions that a use story
- Rules that dictate teh
TODO: review

Components:
- Conditions of satisfaction: What stakeholders need t- see
- Positive and negative scenarios
- Boundaries and constaints

Acceptence criteria is crucial because:
- It defines the scope
- Helps reach consensus with stakeholders and developers s what's required is clear and documentated
- Descriving scenarios: how it will behave under normal and abnormal conditions, e.g. incorrect input or unexpected user behavioour

Best ways t- wite acceptance criteria:
- Plain lanuage: The use can login with a usename and password
- Scenario: Use places an order with items in the cart. When the user hits place order, payment will be charged and order quantities ill be updated
- Given-when-then: Given the user is on the home page, when they click add t- art button, bht eproduct is added t- ehir cart
- Business rules: The discount whould be applied automatically once three qualifying products are added t- the cart.

Key characteristics:

- Measruable and specific
- Testable and verifiable
- Based on user requirements
- Clear and consise
- Independent and atomic: each acceptance criteria can be evaluated separately
- Prioritized and relevant: Stakeholders know the priority of features needed.
- Align with business goals

## Acceptance Test-driven Development

- Agile development approach that emphasizes collaboration with developers, testers, and stakeholders
- Extends TDD by incoproating the perspectives of business stakeholders
- Written in business-friendly language that stakeholdes can understand
- Collaoratively designed t- get rapid feedback from stakeholders and get developers and testers on the same page.

How t- write ATDD:
- Collaborative Requirements Gathering
- Formulating Acceptance Criteria
- Acceptance Test Creation
- Automate Acceptance Tests

- Test Execution and Validation
- Continuous Collaboration and Feedback
- Continuous Improvement

ATDD is a customer-centric approach to development where requirements are validated through executable tests, leading to a higher degree of condience in the software's quality and functionality.
