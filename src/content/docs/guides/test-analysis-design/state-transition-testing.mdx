title: State Transition Testing
---

Ensures the system responds correctly to changes in state.

Discreet application states and the transitions and values that are sent when changing state must be documented.

## Guard conditions

Conditions that must be satisfied in order for a state transition to occur.

## State table

Mirrors the functions of a state transition diagram, with rows symbolizing the states while the columns depict events, including guard conditions.

## Coverage criteria

- Specific conditions and combinations of transitions that need to be tested to ensure adequate coverage.
- Involves defining all possible states and transitions, both valid and invalid.

The corresponding state transition table lists all the test case combinations that have a state starting point.
