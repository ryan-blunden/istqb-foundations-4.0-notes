title: Error Guessing
---

It's the "have we thought about if this happens?"

Error guessing leverages the tester's intuition, experiencve, and domain knowledge to identify potential defects.

Expeirenced testers can anticinpate or guess where errors might occurt based on their knowledge of commoon software issues, development mistakes, and possible user interactions.

A generic tester can look at the generic requiremetns, but they don't have the domain knowledge to go further.

Especially useful when formal requirements or specs are incomplete. Error guessing can then be used to fill in the gaps.

Relies on creative thinking and experience to uncover defects that might not be identified through formnal or structured testing approaches.

Opportunity for testers to leverage their expertise to identify potential areas of risk.

Key points

1. Tester's expertise to anticipate areas where defects are likely to occur
2. Intuition base to use experince and creative thinking to anticipate potential errors. 
3. Lack of formal requirement or specs
4. Focus on risky areas where errors are more likely to occur

People with high empathy tend to be great error guessors as they are great at putting themselves in the user's shoes.

Interviewers are now looking for creativity and empathy as attributes.
