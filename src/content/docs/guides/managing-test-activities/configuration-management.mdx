**A. Version control**  
- Version control provides a history of changes to code and other versioned artifacts.

**B. Baseline management**  
- Establishes baselines which are snapshots of the software and its configuration
- Reference points for testing and help maintain stability during testing
- Testers can compare the baseline with the latest build to identify changes

**C. Configuration identification**  
- Identifying and documenting configuration items, configuration management plans, naming conventions etc.

**D. Change control**  
- Process for evaluating proposed changes which are prioritized and approved based on impact and alignment with business and project objectives.
- Prevents unauthorized changes and ensures following of processes and documentation

**E. Configuration Status Accounting**  
- Documentation of versions, changes, approvals

**F. Configuration Audits and Reviews**  
- Ensures that configuration standards are adhered to and meet required specifications
- Improves traceability

## Summary and Benefits

- Configuration Management ensures proper version control of test artifacts, allowing testers to work with up-to-date assets.
- It helps manage test environments to match production, reducing risks caused by environmental discrepancies.
- By establishing baselines, it improves traceability between requirements, test cases, and defects, enabling better change management.
- Configuration Management aids in creating reproducible test scenarios and supports parallel testing efforts, speeding up the process.

"QA belongs to everybody!". It's a "whole-team approach."
