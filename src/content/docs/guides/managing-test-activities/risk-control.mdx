title: Risk Control
---

Systematically identify, analyze, prioritize, and mitigate risks that could impact testing and therefore, product quality.

You can create a points system assigned to risks, then include the final points list in your final test report to identify risks left outstanding.

Continuously monitor risks to track their status and if appropriate, reassess their impact and priority.

For risk monitoring:

1. Set performance benchmarks
2. Implement monitoring tools
3. Regular check-ins
4. Adjust test plans
5. Update stakeholders
