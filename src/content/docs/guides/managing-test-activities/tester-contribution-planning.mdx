title: Tester's Contribution to Iteration and Release Planning
---

Release planing is a longer-term view that focusses on the entire release of a product.

Release planning focuses on the broader scope, looking at the overall release of a product, whereas iteration planning narrows down to individual cycles.

Testers are crucial during iteration and release planning by providing valuable insights to testing activities required.

Testers contributions can include:

1. Estimating Testing Effort
2. Defining Test Criteria 
3. Identifying Test Scenarios
4. Prioritizing Test Cases
5. Identifying test data and environment requirements
6. Identifying dependencies and risks
7. Feedback on user stories
8. Collaborating in iteration retrospectives
