When it comes to execution:
- What are the defects, severity, and the split
- Tests passed, fails, blocked, N/A (have we mitigted the risks identified at the start through our testing?)
- One pager with metrics, graphs, quick summary of where things are at
- Metrics, regression, security, perf
- Need to be able to present the data that leadership need to know where things are at
- Important that the key data is there so informed decisions can be made, e.g. 50 P1s and P2s still remaining to be tested and time is running out.

## Typical Entry Criteria

- Availability of testable requirements, user stories, and/or models (e.g., when following
a model-based testing strategy)
- Availability of test items that have met the exit criteria for any prior test levels
- Availability of test environment
- Availability of necessary test tools
- Availability of test data and other necessary resource

## Typical Exit Criteria

- Planned tests have been executed
- A defined level of coverage (e.g., of requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria,
risks, code) has been achieved
- The number of unresolved defects is within an agreed limit
- The number of estimated remaining defects is sufficiently low
- The evaluated levels of reliability, performance efficiency, usability, security, and other
relevant quality characteristics are sufficient
- Cost/time

Entry and exit criteria are in your test plan and summary report.
