Test pyramid is a guide for creating a balanced testing strategy.

More fast tests and less slow tests to speed up the feedback loop.

Plus failures in end-to-end tests require more debugging to identify the actual point of failure and root cause. 

Unit and integration tests that can be run locally show precisely where the error occurred, and are easier to debug (stack track) and fix.

Open source vs. closed source automation frameworks:

Why you wouldn't use an open source automation framework:
* You can't sue an open source organization but you can sue a service provider
* Services provide support, SLAs, and because you've paid for it, you can jump on the phone with a sev 1 and they'll help you fix it straight away.
* This is why companies of similar sizes tend to work with similar automation frameworks.
* You don't want a single point of failure (e.g. internal tool on open source by one person) when something goes wrong.
