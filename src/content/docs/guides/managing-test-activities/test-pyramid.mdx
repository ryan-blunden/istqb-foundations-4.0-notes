Test pyramid is a guide for creating a balanced testing strategy.

More fast tests and less slow tests to speed up the feedback loop.

Plus failures in end-to-end tests require more debugging to identify the actual point of failure and root cause. 

Unit and integration tests that can be run locally show precisely where the error occurred, and are easier to debug (stack track) and fix.

Open source vs. closed source automation frameworks:

## Question I asked: Why would a company not use an open source automation framework:
* You can't sue an open source organization due to upgrade issues, breakages etc, but you can sue a service provider.
* Services provide support, SLAs, and because you've paid for it, you can jump on the phone with a sev 1 and they're heavily obligated to be responsive and fix it immediately because a renewal is potentially on the line.
* This is why companies of similar sizes tend to work with similar automation frameworks.
* You don't want a single point of failure (e.g. internal expert of internal or open source leaves or is sick) when something goes wrong.
