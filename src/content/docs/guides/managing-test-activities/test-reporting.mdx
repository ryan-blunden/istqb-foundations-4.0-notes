Purpose, Content and Audience for Test Reports

## Purpose

• Test reports serve the purpose of effectively communicating the progress, findings, and outcomes
of testing activities to stakeholders.
• They provide visibility into the testing process, present the results of executed test cases,
highlight identified defects, and convey the overall quality of the software being tested.
• The primary goal is to inform stakeholders about the current state of the software and testing
efforts.
Test reports typically include a testing summary that outlines the objectives, scope, and timelines
of the testing activities.
• The test execution status section provides details on the number of test cases executed, passed,
failed, and remaining, offering insights into the progress of testing.
• The defect summary presents a summary of identified defects, including their severity, priority,
and status, highlighting areas that require attention and potential risks.

## Audience

• The primary audience for test reports includes project managers, development teams, quality
assurance teams, product owners, and other stakeholders involved in the software development
and testing process.
• Project managers rely on reports to monitor progress and make informed decisions about
resource allocation and project planning.
• Development and QA teams use the reports to understand the test results and address identified
defects.
