Risk people profiles:

1. Not overly worried by risks, downplay the likelhood, downplay the impact.
2. More balaned, considering risks and more likely to agree it's a genuine risk.
3. Others raise a lot of risks and place a large emphasis on those risks.

Which one a person falls in is usually the result of (or lack of) prvious experience when risks were involved.

When assessing risk, be aware of unconscious bias towards the level of risks you're seeing and try to take each project on its own meritsâ€”not presuming it will be like others before it.
