## Side note: A person's risk profile

People typically fall are one of the following:

1. Not overly worried by risks, downplay the likelihood and impact.
2. More balance, considering risks and more likely to agree it's a genuine risk.
3. Others raise a lot of risks and place a large emphasis on those risks.

Which one a person falls in is usually the result of (or lack of) previous experience when risks were involved.

When assessing risk, be aware of unconscious bias towards the level of risks you're seeing and try to take each project on its own meritsâ€”not (don't presume it will be like others before it).

## Risk attributes

Potential impact of risk (e.g. financial penalty, loss of life)

**Likelihood or probability**  
Indicates probability of risk occurring. Considers factors such as complexity of software, stability of test environment, skills of testing team, presence of similar issues in previous projects.
