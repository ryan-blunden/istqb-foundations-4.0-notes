Risk identification and risk assessment.

You want to encourage people to speak up.

Two phases:

- **Detection phase**  
Inventory of risks, which stakeholders can identify them, use brain storming sessions, workshops, interviews, cause-effect diagrams.
- **Evaluation phase**  
Classify identified risks, asses probability, consequences, and rank according to urgency.

Classification is beneficial for mitigation because risks in the same group can often be mitigated in similar ways.

**1. Technical Risks**:  
New technology that the development team is not familiar with could lead to delays. Integrating existing systems with new infrastructure and services.

**2. Operational Risks**:  
- High traffic volumes could overwhelm the server capacity, leading to downtime or slow performance.
- Third-party logistics providers might not integrate seamlessly with the new system.

**3. Business Risks**:  
- Competitors might launch similar features
- Changes in regulatory requirements

**4. Project Risks**:  
- Key people with tacit knowledge may leave
- Project timeline may be too aggressive, leading to rushed development and inadequate testing.
- If testing is compromised, quality is compromised which is not acceptable. But scope can be reduced which doesn't impact quality.
- Don't skimp on quality just to follow a plan and get all the things done.

**5. Financial Risks**:  
- Budget allocated may be insufficient due to unforeseen costs

**6. Security Risks**:  
- Potential vulnerabilities
- Insecure data storage and access practices
- Shift-left by introducing security experts early in the process

**7. Legal Risks**:  
- Intellectual disputes
- Software license breaches
- Failing to comply with industry relations, privacy and data prodction laws

## Risk Assessment

Prioritize risks based on severity and likelihood of occurrence.

Example of Risk Assessment

Let's consider a software development project as an example to illustrate risk assessment.

1. **Risk Identification**: Imagine a project team has identified several risks to their project, such as:
- Risk A: Lack of skilled developers in a specific programming language needed for the project.
- Risk B: Uncertain customer requirements that might lead to frequent changes.
- Risk C: Third-party vendor dependency for critical project components.

2. **Risk Analysis**: For each identified risk, the team would analyze and assess:
- Likelihood (Probability): The chance that a risk will occur.
- Impact (Consequence): The potential negative effect on the project if the risk occurs.

3. **Risk Evaluation**:
- **Risk A (Lack of skilled developers)**:
  - **Likelihood**: High - Currently, there is a shortage of developers with the required skills in the job market.
  - **Impact**: Medium - The project could face delays, but with enough lead time, developers could be trained or hired.

- **Risk B (Uncertain customer requirements)**:
  - **Likelihood**: Medium - The customer has a history of changing their mind, but there's an agreed-upon requirements management process.
  - **Impact**: High - Changes could significantly disrupt the project timeline and budget.

- **Risk C (Third-party vendor dependency)**:
  - **Likelihood**: Low - The vendor has a good track record, but their component is complex.
  - **Impact**: High - Without the component, the project can't proceed, and no alternative vendors are available.

Although Risk C has a low likelihood, its high impact might priorities it over Risk A which has a high likelihood but
only medium impact. The priority for mitigation might be:
1. Risk B - Due to high impact and medium likelihood.
2. Risk C - Due to high impact, despite low likelihood.
3. Risk A - Due to medium impact, even with high likelihood.

5. **Risk Mitigation Planning**:  
- **Risk A**: The team might decide to invest in training for existing staff or initiate a recruiting campaign ahead of time.
- **Risk B**: The team could engage more frequently with the customer to solidify requirements and include contingency time and budget for changes.
- **Risk C**: They might research alternative solutions or work closely with the vendor to understand potential issues and ensure there's a support plan in place.

> **EXAM**
> Based on these provided rules, which risk is the highest priority? The exam question will give you the rules and context so you can make an informed decision. Weight towards impact, then likelihood.

Every organization has a different way of ranking risks.
