title: Purpose and Content of a Test Plan
---

First question: Is there a mandated way of doing it here?

As brief as possible, but also as detailed as necessary.

Outlines the purpose, scope, objectives, and approach of software testing.

**Intro**  
Provides an overview of the project, it's objetives, and the roel of the test plan in achieving those objectives.

**Objectives**  
Clearly defines the goals and objectives fo the testing effort, outling what is to be achived through the testing activities.

**Test Scope**  
Defines th the boundaries of the testing effort by specifying what will be included and excluded from testing. Stakeholders just want to know what will and won't be tested. Map the user stories to the test cases.

**Test Approach**  
Describes the overall strategy and approach for conducting the testing, including the types of tests to be performed (e.g. black and or white box, functional, performance, security), the testing techniues required, and mnethogliges employed and any specific tools or resources to be utilized. 

Specifically, it should cover:
- What kinds of tests are we performing? 
- Requirements tracability matrix. 
- Are we lookiong at exploratory, error guessing. 
- What levels (e.g. component, integration, system) and for each level, specify who is doing it. Grid (TDD: Developers). 
- For performance, how will you be performing it. 
- Security, have you lined up the security early to get them involved at the start so we know what the security risks are and what should be checked and tested. 
- What techniques (e.g. boundary testing) will you be using. What tools are rsourcs are you suing, what team members are involved.
- Approach is contextual. You don't need all of this detail if its a simple website. 

**Test Deliverables**  
- Sepecific docsuments and artifacts, test plans, cases, scripts, reports

**Test Shedule**  
Outlines the timeline and sequencing of the testing activities, including key milestones and dependencies on other project activities.

**Test Environment** 
Describes the hardware, software, and network configurations required to
support the testing efforts, including any necessary test data and test
environments setup.

What is a tester's value:
- Make money
- Save money
- Prevent data leaks
- Move as fast as possible

Typical test plan:
- Product Analysis
- Designing Test Strategy
- Defining Objectives
- Establish Test Criteria
- Planning Resource Allocation
- Planning Setup of Test Environment
- Determine test schedule and estimation
- Establish Test Deliverables
