My collection of notes from the ISTQB Foundation Level in Software Testing.

<FAQList title="FAQs">
  <FAQ title="How do you charge for your services?">
    <p>
      I usually charge a set rate for projects and larger jobs with predefined
      scope or an hourly rate for small one-off tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In any case, you'll always receive a cost estimate up-front and I will
      provide you with a detailed invoice for each project.
    </p>
  </FAQ>
  <FAQ title="How long does it take to complete a project?">
    <p>
      The time frame for completion depends upon the scope and complexity of
      work and how many other jobs are in the pipeline.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more we work together and the greater understanding I have of your
      product and services, the faster I can turn around work.
    </p>
    <p>
      I produce content quickly and have a collaborative and iterative process
      to ensure the content is always heading in the right direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll send you updates frequently so you're always aware of my progress and
      will let you know ahead of time if there are unforeseen delays or issues.
    </p>
  </FAQ>
  <FAQ title="How do you communicate with your clients?">
    <p>
      I communicate using whatever method and platform (e.g. Slack Connect)
      works best for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am flexible and responsive, and will reply to your messages and emails
      as soon as possible.
    </p>
  </FAQ>
  <FAQ title="How do you handle revisions and feedback?">
    <p>
      I don't tend to have set rules around the number of revisions and feedback
      as I find good planning, communication of scope, and preparation ahead of
      time negate the need for a large number of revisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      My collaborative approach means we get to a final version relatively
      quickly because I ensure we remain aligned on the content goals and vision
      as the project progresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      I want you to be really happy (not just satisfied), with the end result
      will gladly accommodate your requests until the content is where it needs
      to be.
    </p>
  </FAQ>
  <FAQ title="How do you deliver your content?">
    <p>
      I deliver my content in whatever format best suits you. I tend to produce
      the drafts in Google docs as it has superb tooling for collaborative
      editing but can publish the content in your CMS or editorial tool of
      choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the conclusion of each project, I'll provide you with the source files,
      images, videos, or any other assets that I used to create the content.
    </p>
  </FAQ>
  <FAQ title="Does the content need to be attributed to you?">
    <p>That's completely your choice!</p>
    <p>
      You can attach my name to blog posts or I can be used as a ghostwriter.
    </p>
  </FAQ>
  <FAQ title="What are the benefits of working with you?">
    <p>
      I'm friendly and easy going, and will feel like a new member of your team.
    </p>
    <p>
      I genuinely care about the impact my work has on your team and business,
      and I will always go the extra mile to make sure you are satisfied and
      happy with the content.
