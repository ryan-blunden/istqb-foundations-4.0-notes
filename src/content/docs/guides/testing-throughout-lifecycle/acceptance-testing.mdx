title: Acceptance Testing
---
Finding defects is not the main focus of acceptance testing!

It's to establish confidence in the system.

Typically performed by the end-users or testers simulating end-users. 

It's not about technical correctnessâ€”but validating that the system delivers what the users and business expect.

It's to answer questions such as "Does this fulfill my needs as a user?" and "Does it provide the required user experience that will encourage me to use and get value from the system?"

Functional and non-functional testing.

Test basis:
- User requirements
- System requirements
- Use cases
- Business processes
- Risk analysis reports

Test objects:
- Business, operational, maintenance, and processes
- Procedures
- Forms and reports

Two types: UAT and OAT

## User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

- Verifies fitness for use by users
- Typically the responsibility of the users

## Operational Acceptance Testing (OAT)

- Verifies the fitness for use of the system by system administrators
- Done by system administrators

For example:
- Restore from backup
- Disaster recovery
- User management
- Maintenance tasks
- Data load and migration
- Security vulnerability testing

Contract and regulation acceptance (e.g., government, legal, safety).

Alpha testing is done at the vendor's site, while Beta testing is done at the customer's site.
