title: Component Testing
---

Usually performed by the developer (e.g., TDD).

TDD example: Drivers and Stubs (GoF design patterns):
- Driver calls into a component
- Stub replaces the component under test
- You're testing the contract and requirements based on the component's response, not the component's behavior

- Unit, module, or program testing

Test basis:
- Component specifications
- Detailed design
- Code
- Data model

Typical test objects:
- Component, units, modules, classes, code, data structures

Issues:
- Code-level issues

No formal defect management. Iterative design process.
