Reflect on past experiences and identify opportunities for improvement.

Start-Stop-Continue

Effectiveness comes down to the culture (can honest opinions be shared?) and facilitation by the Scrum Master/project lead.

Testers can share their observations, insights, and suggestions to improve the testing process and deliver higher-quality software.
