title: Shift Left Approach
---
Initiate testing activities as early as possible.

It's all about collaboration between developers, testers, and stakeholders.

This approach makes testing not just a phase of the SDLC, but a practice and discipline that's integrated into the SDLC process.

It breaks down testing boundaries between developers and testers.

Faster feedback loops, more efficient development processes, fewer failures found in dynamic testing, and better quality and productivity.

## Good practices

* **Reviewing specifications**  
  Identify ambiguities, incompleteness, and inconsistencies.
* **Write test cases early**  
  Encourages developers to embrace a testing mindset from the onset.
* **CI/CD fast feedback**  
  Pre-commit hooks also help prevent issues before code is pushed.
* **Static analysis**  
  Automated and consistent identification of software quality issues.
* **Performing non-functional testing early**  
  Aspects such as performance, stress, and accessibility should be tested in the development phase.
