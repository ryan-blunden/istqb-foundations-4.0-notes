title: Impact of the Software Development Lifecycle on Testing
---

1. **Integration of testing**  
   The SDLC determines when testing activities are integrated (separate phase or integrated).

2. **Documentation style**  
   The SDLC guides the style of test documentation. Waterfall requires more detailed and comprehensive documentation as it's an entire phase. Agile favors concise, flexible, and iterative docs.

3. **Testing techniques**  
   Requirements-based (typical in Waterfall) vs. exploratory (typically in Agile).

4. **Test automation**  
   If you can automate tasks that are done repeatedly and are labor-intensive, why wouldn't you? But automation has a bad reputation because of the time lost to maintenance. It favors Agile as requirements and functionality change more rapidly.

5. **Tester's Role**  
   It's good to have strengths and specializations, but you want to have multi-functional teams so there is no single point of failure.

## Sequential Model

- Requirements gathering and analysis
- System design
- Implementation/Coding
- Testing and Deployment

## V-Model

- Requirements analysis: user needs, system specs
- System design: system architecture based on requirements
- High-level test planning: cover design and requirements
- Unit testing: individual units of functionality
