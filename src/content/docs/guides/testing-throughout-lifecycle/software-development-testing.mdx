title: Software Development and Software Testing
---

Good testing characteristics that apply to any SDLC model:
- Test activity for every development activity.
- Each test level has its own test objectives.
- Test analysis and design begin at the same time as the development activity.
- Testers have a voice in defining and refining requirements and review all available design artifacts (static testing) early, preferably before development begins.
