title: DevOps and Testing
---

- DevOps makes continuous deployment possible by integrating test steps as part of the validation, verification, and deployment process.
- DevOps requires 100% confidence in your test suite and testing environments, as they are the gate between a release going out or not.
- Not just unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Any sort of "testing" process can be used to identify defects and regressions, e.g., monitoring code instrumentation and application metrics to catch performance regressions.

## Benefits

1. Fast Feedback  
2. Shift-left approach (TDD, static analysis)  
3. Stable, predictable, and production-quality test environments  
4. View on non-functional characteristics (e.g., security, performance)  
5. Reduces manual testing as DevOps is about automation  
6. Minimized regression risk through automated testing  
7. Optimal configuration of CI/CD test jobs and pipelines for speed and reliability  
8. CI/CD tool maintenance
