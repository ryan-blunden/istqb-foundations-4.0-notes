title: Integration Testing
---
Tests interactions between separate components without the need for end-to-end tests.

### Test Basis:
- Software and System Design
- Architecture
- Workflows
- Use Cases
  - Sequence diagrams

### Test objects:
- Sub-systems and databases
- Infrastructure
- Interfaces
  - APIs

### Two types of integration testing:
- **Component**  
  Verifies smaller units that have unit tests work together correctly (e.g., correct interface, data flow).
  
- **System**  
  Tests interaction between systems such as databases, internal and external APIs, and infrastructure. Often requires mocking (e.g., external payment gateway) and often does work that end-to-end testing cannot or should not.
