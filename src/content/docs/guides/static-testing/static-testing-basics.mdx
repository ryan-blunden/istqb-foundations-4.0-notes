80% of your value is in Static Testing.

- Finds causes of failure (not the failure itself because that's in dynamic testing)
- Finds them early
- Defect cheap to fix

With dynamic:
- Finds the failures themselves
- Finds them late
- Defect expensive to fix

The extent to which static testing is possible depends upon the team and work standards, e.g., do developers need to provide a design document for a user story before beginning to code?

Embracing static testing is about the team seeing that ensuring quality is a team effort.

Effective static testing identifies defects early so they are quick and easy to refectify. A lot of it is just talking to your team memvers to ensure everyone genuinely understands the feature.

- Purpose
- Techniques
- Review Process: Analyzing sotwe artifacts to find defects
- Review types: Informal review, walkthrough, tech review, inspection
- Benefits: 

Static testing can be taken really well by the team when they feel that you're trying to help them and save them effort and frustration.

You're speaking up and putting a lot of your test input up-front instead of once features have been coded up.
