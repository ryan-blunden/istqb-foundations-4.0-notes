## During the interview

It's about values. Show that you're obsessed with quality, passionate, and keen to learn.

"I'm here to help people, make their lives easier, maximize the quality of the product and the user experience, which in turn benefits the business."

### Team fit

Hiring managers aren't just looking for skills—they're looking for a balance of personality types and working styles (e.g., technical or creative), as a good team needs a mix of different personalities and strengths to function well.

So ensure your values, working style, and strengths come through clearly in your resume and during the interview process.

* Automated regression testing is cool—but the most value from testing comes from static testing.

### Test Analysis and Design

* Intelligent design focuses on what's required.
* The more efficient you are, the higher the quality of tests.

## Why is testing necessary?
