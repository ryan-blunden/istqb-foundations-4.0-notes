## Benefits

- Time saved by reducing repetitive manual work
- Prevention of simple human errors through greater consistency and repeatability
- More objective assessment and measurement of test coverage 
- Easier access to information about testing to support test management and reporting
- Reduced test execution times for earlier defect detection and faster feedback
- More time for testers to design new, deeper, and more effective tests

## Risks

- Unrealistic expectations about tool benefits
- Inaccurate estimations of time, costs, and effort
- Using a test tool when manually testing is more effective
- Over-reliance on automation
- Dependency on the tool vendor. Do a good POC to put it through its paces
- Issues with open source software
- Incompatibility with development platform
- Choosing an unsuitable tool for regulatory and safety compliances
