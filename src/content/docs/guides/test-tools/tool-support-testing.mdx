- Improve efficiency
- Automating previously manual tasks (e.g. building real-time reports using data from different sources)
- Automating activities that can't be done manually (e.g. performance testing)
- Increase reliability of testing

## Tool types

Most modern tools include most or all of these:

Here are the summarized versions of the bullet points:

**Management Tools**  
Test management tools help organize and track test cases, schedules, and resources, while offering features for traceability, monitoring, and reporting.

**Static Testing Tools**  
These tools analyze source code and documentation without execution, identifying early defects, coding errors, and adherence to standards.

**Test Design and Implementation Tools**  
These tools aid in creating and developing test cases and scripts, offering features like test specification, data generation, and debugging.

**Test Execution and Coverage Tools**  
These tools automate test execution, capture results, and measure code coverage, ensuring the completeness of testing.

- **Non-functional Testing Tools**: 
These tools focus on performance, security, reliability, usability, and compatibility, simulating real-world scenarios to evaluate system behavior under different conditions.

- **DevOps Tools**: 
DevOps tools integrate testing into CI/CD pipelines, automating the testing process, environment provisioning, and deployment to facilitate collaboration between development and operations teams.

- **Collaboration Tools**: 
Collaboration tools enhance communication and teamwork among testing teams and stakeholders by offering platforms like issue tracking, wikis, and instant messaging.

- **Virtual Machines (VMs)**: 
VMs create isolated environments for testing different operating systems and configurations, enabling standardized environments and facilitating test repeatability with snapshots.

- **Containerization Tools**: 
Containerization packages applications and dependencies into containers like Docker, ensuring consistent testing across environments and simplifying deployment and scaling.

- **Spreadsheet Tools**: 
Tools like Excel or Google Sheets support various testing activities, including test case and data management, defect tracking, execution logs, reports, metrics, data validation, and traceability matrices.
