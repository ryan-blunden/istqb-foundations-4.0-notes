title: Generic Skills Required for Testing
---

## Different styles of testers and people

- Detail focussed
- Very technical, more focussed on technical details
- Less technical, but mot user focussed
- Creative (not detailed, but will spot thins others don't)
- Driven, very direct, don't need a lot of detail
- Harmonious (glue the team together)

Build teams that are complimentary (don't want a team of detailed people).

But AI can go a long way to helping you address your weaknesses (e.g. helping create test cases you haven't thought of). Get AI do the initial heavy lifting (e.g stuff you would definitely have thought of), then put your brain to work on the importance generic stuff AI isn't going to think of.
