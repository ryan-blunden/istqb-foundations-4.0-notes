title: Advantages of the Whole Team Approach
---

Advantages:

- Synergy through diverse skill sets. Everyone learns more and can do more
- Better communication and collaboration
- More about getting stuff done, not labels and discrete responsibilities
- Higher-performing teams with higher quality
- Knowledge transfer
- Better alignment with business goals
- Adaptable test strategies, 4-pager, get it out in an hour, start getting feedback straight away. Much better way to get feedback. Less investment for others to start sharing feedback.
- Shared ownership
- Maintains independence when needed. You can still carve out your niche.

Like a sports team as opposed to different roles that themselves are a team, e.g. devs and testers working together instead of developers finishing, then throwing it over the fence.

Get stuff out there in draft ASAP to start getting feedback.

Empathy is so crucial. It allows you to work with people by focusing on them, not how you're reacting to them.
