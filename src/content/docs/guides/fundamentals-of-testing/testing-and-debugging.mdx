## Review Questions

> **EXAM:** The Debugging diagram is very important for the exam.  
> **EXAM:** What's the difference between testing and debugging?  
> For dynamic testing, it's a "failure" if something doesn't work.  
> Failure = issue  
> Default = debugging to identify the failure

1. Find a failure
2. Root cause analysis
3. Apply fix
4. Create test if not covered by existing requirements
5. Apply and verify fix

Standard debugging process:

* Reproduction
* Diagnosis (root cause analysis)
* Fix

Testing and debugging are different.

Testing is concerned with the evaluation and verification process of identifying defects, regressions, quality-related issues, and ensuring that the software meets all defined requirements.

Debugging focuses on determining the root cause (e.g., state analysis, UI issues, analyzing code, logs, errors) of a discovered defect and consistently reproducing it to establish the conditions under which it occurs.

Debugging is a crucial skill, as the time to fix an issue is heavily dependent upon the quality of information provided to the development team, making it easier for them to implement a fix.

## Testing

### Debugging

Debugging is understanding and resolving the underlying causes of failure.

Standard process:

* Reproduction of failure (so testers and devs see the same thing)
* Diagnosis to identify the root cause (as deep as necessary)
* Fixing the cause
