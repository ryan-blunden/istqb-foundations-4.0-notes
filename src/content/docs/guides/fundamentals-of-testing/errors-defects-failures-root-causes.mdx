## Errors

Mistakes made during the development process.

Remember that everyone is doing their best. Errors are unintentional. Everyone is human. Everyone makes mistakes. We can help them.

## Defects

Flaws or malfunctions that deviate from the intended behavior or design.

## Failures

Failures occur when the software does not perform its intended functions.

### Root Cause

Identifies the underlying reason or source of a defect or failure.

## Causes of software defects

* Humans are fallible
* Pressure
* Complexity

An error (mistake by human)   
⬇️  
causes a defect/fault/bug (result of an error, e.g. someone coded it incorrectly)  
⬇️  
causes a failure (system does not perform as expected, e.g. wages aren't paid in 4 decimal places)

## Other causes of failure

Failures can occur under environmental conditions (physical, not just infra).
