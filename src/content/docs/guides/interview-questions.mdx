  </FAQ>
  <FAQ title="4. How do you handle synchronization issues in Selenium using Java?">
    I use implicit waits, explicit waits, and fluent waits to handle
    synchronization issues. Implicit waits set a default timeout for all
    elements, while explicit waits allow for custom conditions. Fluent waits
    combine polling and timeout conditions.
  </FAQ>
  <FAQ title="5. Explain the use of TestNG in Selenium automation testing.">
    TestNG provides features like annotations, assertions, parameterization, and
    reporting that enhance Selenium's capabilities. It allows for parallel
    execution, data-driven testing, and grouping of test cases.
  </FAQ>
  <FAQ title="6. How do you generate reports in Selenium using Java?">
    I use reporting frameworks like ExtentReports, TestNG Reports, and Allure
    Reports to generate detailed test reports. These frameworks provide features
    like screenshots on failure, test status, and logs.

    interactions like hover, drag and drop, and double-click. It helps simulate
    complex user actions that are not possible with basic click and send keys
    commands.
  </FAQ>
  <FAQ title="8. How do you handle alerts and pop-ups in Selenium using Java?">
    I use the switchTo().alert() method to switch to the alert and then use
    accept(), dismiss(), or sendKeys() to handle the alert. For pop-ups, I use
    the switchTo().window() method to switch to the new window and perform the
    necessary actions.
  </FAQ>
  <FAQ title="9. Explain the concept of data-driven testing in Selenium.">
    Data-driven testing involves separating test data from test scripts and
    using external data sources like Excel, CSV, or databases to drive test
    cases. It allows for testing the same functionality with different sets of
    data without modifying the test scripts.
  </FAQ>
  <FAQ title="10. How do you handle cookies and sessions in Selenium using Java?">
    I use the manage().getCookies() and manage().addCookie() methods to handle
    cookies in Selenium. For sessions, I use the manage().getCookieNamed() and
    manage().deleteCookieNamed() methods to retrieve and delete specific
    cookies.

    8) and constants. Classes can extend only one abstract class, but they can
    implement multiple interfaces.
  </FAQ>
  <FAQ title="3. What is the difference between == and .equals() in Java?">
    == compares object references, while .equals() compares the content of
    objects. For primitive types, == compares the values.

    type of exception to catch. The finally block is used for cleanup code that
    should run regardless of an exception.
  </FAQ>
  <FAQ title="5. Explain the purpose of the synchronized keyword in Java.">
    The synchronized keyword is used to control access to critical sections of
    code to prevent race conditions and ensure thread safety.
  </FAQ>
  <FAQ title="6. What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList in Java?">

    elements. ArrayList provides constant-time access to elements by index,
    while LinkedList provides constant-time access to elements at the beginning
    and end of the list.
  </FAQ>
  <FAQ title="7. Explain the purpose of the hashCode() and equals() methods.">
    The hashCode() method returns an integer hash code value for an object. The
    equals() method compares two objects for equality. These methods are used
    together to ensure that objects with the same content have the same hash
    code value.

  <FAQ title="22. What is the purpose of the instanceof operator?">
    The instanceof operator is used to test whether an object is an instance of
    a specific class or subclass.
  </FAQ>
  <FAQ title="23. What is the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions?">
    Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time, while unchecked exceptions

    providing information to the compiler or runtime.
  </FAQ>
  <FAQ title="26. What is the purpose of the finalize() method?">
    The finalize() method is called by the garbage collector before an object is
    removed from memory. It can be overridden to perform cleanup operations.
  </FAQ>
  <FAQ title="27. What is the difference between throw and throws?">
    throw is used to explicitly throw an exception, while throws is used in
    method declarations to indicate that a method can throw exceptions.

  </FAQ>
  <FAQ title="30. Explain the concept of inheritance in Java.">
    Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (subclass) inherits properties
    and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (superclass). It promotes
    code reuse.
  </FAQ>
  <FAQ title="31. What is the difference between abstract class and interface?">
    An abstract class can have both abstract and concrete methods, while an
    interface can only have abstract methods (prior to Java 8). A class can

    They can be used as the assignment target for lambda expressions.
  </FAQ>
  <FAQ title="33. What are the access modifiers in Java?">
    The access modifiers in Java are public, protected, private, and
    package-private (default). They control the visibility of classes, methods,
    and variables.
  </FAQ>
  <FAQ title="34. What is method overloading?">
    Method overloading allows a class to have multiple methods with the same
    name but different parameter lists (types or number of parameters).
  </FAQ>
  <FAQ title="35. What is the transient keyword?">
    The transient keyword is used in serialization to indicate that a field
    should not be serialized. It will not be saved when the object is converted
    to a byte stream.
  </FAQ>
  <FAQ title="36. Explain the concept of polymorphism in Java.">
    Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object that
    it is acting upon. It can be achieved through method overriding and method
    overloading.

  <FAQ title="37. What is the purpose of the clone() method?">
    The clone() method is used to create a copy of an object. The class must
    implement the Cloneable interface to allow cloning.
  </FAQ>
  <FAQ title="38. What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy?">
    A shallow copy creates a new object but copies the references of the
    original object's fields. A deep copy creates a new object and recursively
    copies all fields, creating copies of mutable objects.
  </FAQ>
  <FAQ title="39. What is a package in Java?">
    A package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and
    interfaces. It helps avoid naming conflicts and controls access.
